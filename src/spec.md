# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add utilization tracker with multi-tasking support (>100%), enhance UI design, enable manual time entry, and implement case editing functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Add utilization tracker that supports concurrent tasks and displays percentages above 100%
- Enhance frontend UI with improved visual hierarchy, spacing, card designs, and form layouts
- Add manual start/end time input fields as alternative to live timer
- Implement case editing functionality allowing modification of all case details and times

**User-visible outcome:** Users can track utilization beyond 100% for multi-tasking scenarios, manually enter case times instead of using the live timer, edit previously logged cases, and experience an improved, more polished interface across all pages.
