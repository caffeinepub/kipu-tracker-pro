# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix non-functional Mode toggle button and resolve case edit update failures in the EMR Case Tracker.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix Mode toggle button in header navigation to properly switch between manual and auto time entry modes
- Ensure mode state synchronizes with CaseTimerControls component
- Debug and fix EditCaseModal case update functionality
- Ensure edited case data successfully submits to backend and reflects in case list

**User-visible outcome:** Users can toggle between manual and auto time entry modes using the header button, and successfully edit and save case information with updates appearing immediately in the case list.
