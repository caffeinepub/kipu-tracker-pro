REQ-32 (UI enhancements) is implemented across multiple components with improved styling, shadows, borders, and spacing. REQ-33 (manual time entry) is implemented with manual mode toggle and datetime-local inputs in both case tracking and batch entry. REQ-34 (case editing) is implemented with a new EditCaseModal component, backend editCase mutation, and edit buttons in the case list.
